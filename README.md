# 🍽️ Recipe Management Application

Welcome to the **Recipe Management Application**! 🎉 This is a Django-based web application built as part of my learning journey to master Django and web development. The project is designed for practice purposes, showcasing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, user authentication, and file uploads in a simple yet functional recipe management system. 🚀

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The Recipe Management Application allows users to:
- **Register** and **log in** to their accounts securely. 🔐
- **Create**, **update**, and **delete** recipes with names, descriptions, and images. 📝
- **Search** for recipes by name. 🔍
- **View** a list of all recipes in a tabular format with images. 🖼️

This project demonstrates my understanding of Django's core concepts, including models, views, templates, URL routing, authentication, and file handling. It uses **Bootstrap 5** for responsive and modern styling. 🌟

## 🛠️ Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - Register with first name, last name, username, and password. ✍️
  - Log in and log out securely. 🚪
  - Passwords are encrypted using Django's built-in authentication system. 🔒
  - Protected routes to ensure only authenticated users can access recipe management features.

- **Recipe Management**:
  - Add new recipes with a name, description, and image. 🍴
  - Update existing recipes, with optional image replacement. ✏️
  - Delete recipes with a single click. 🗑️
  - Search recipes by name using a case-insensitive filter. 🔎

- **Responsive UI**:
  - Clean and user-friendly interface built with Bootstrap 5. 📱
  - Displays recipes in a table with images, names, descriptions, and action buttons.

- **File Uploads**:
  - Upload recipe images, stored in the `public/static/receipe` directory. 🖼️
  - Images are displayed in the recipe list with fixed dimensions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed 🐍
- Django 5.2 (`pip install django`)
- Pillow for image handling (`pip install pillow`)
- A modern web browser 🌐

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <>
   cd Djcrudoperation
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install django pillow
   ```

4. **Apply migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser** (optional, for admin access):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the application**:

## 📚 Learning Journey

This project was built as part of my **Django learning journey**. Through this project, I explored:
- Django's **MTV (Model-Template-View)** architecture. 🏗️
- **ORM** for database interactions. 🗄️
- **Authentication** and **authorization** for secure access. 🔐
- **File uploads** for handling images. 🖼️
- **Bootstrap** for responsive design. 🎨
- **CRUD operations** for managing data. 📝

This hands-on experience helped solidify my understanding of Django and web development concepts, and I'm excited to continue building more complex projects! 🚀

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **Image Upload**: If no image is provided during an update, the existing image remains unchanged (intentional, but could be improved).
- **Search**: Limited to recipe names only; could be extended to descriptions.
- **Validation**: Basic form validation is in place, but more robust checks (e.g., file size limits) could be added.
- **Unused App**: The `home` app appears unused and may be a typo or remnant; consider removing or integrating it.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add **pagination** for the recipe list. 📄
- Implement **recipe categories** or tags. 🏷️
- Allow users to **edit their profiles**. 👤
- Add **client-side validation** for forms. ✅
- Deploy the app to a production server (e.g., Heroku, AWS). ☁️
